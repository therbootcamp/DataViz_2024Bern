In this practical, you will produce a visualization of your own for the `imdb.csv` (and potentially the `oscars.csv`) data illustrating an insight of your choice.

The `imdb.csv` data set contains the 1000 highest rated movies on the movie platform IMDb (https://imdb.com/). It has the following columns:

- year: Year the movie was released
- title: Title of the movie
- synopsis: Synopsis
- genre: Movie Genres (multiple labels seperated by ",")
- director: Movie director
- stars: Four primary movie stars in the movie
- duration: Duration of the movie
- maturity_rating: Maturity rating of the movie (e.g., PG-13)
- imdb_rating: Average rating on IMDb a scale from 1 to 10 
- n_votes: Number of votes on IMDb
- meta_score: Score on the Metacritic (https://www.metacritic.com/) platform
- revenue: Movie revenue in USD
- poster: URL to the movie poster

The `oscars.csv` data set contains all Oscar winners up to today. It has the following columns:

- title: Title of the movie
- award_class: Class of the award (e.g., Acting)
- award_category: Category of the Award (e.g., ACTRESS IN A SUPPORTING ROLE)
- name: Name(s) of person/people receiving the Oscar

# 0 - Preliminaries

1. Load the `tidyverse` and the `imdb.csv` and `oscars.csv` data. Print the data and familiarize yourself with their contents before you proceed to the next section.

# 1 - Produce a visualization

1. Think about a question that may lead to an interesting insight about the data. Below are a few ideas; however, note that some require more serious data processing. Feel free to choose a question of your own. Use either only the `imdb` or the `imdb` and `oscars` data sets. 

- What director or stars were most successful in terms of revenue (or Oscars)?
- Do longer movies receive better ratings?
- What genre is most popular?
- How are number of votes and ratings related?
- Are movies that receive more positive ratings?
- Which actor pairs appear often together? 

2. Spend 5 minutes to sketch out how a plot that effectively addresses your question might look like. You can do this on a piece of paper or a program like keynote or powerpoint.

3. Go ahead and implement your plot!
