In this practical, you will [**recreate this html report**](https://therbootcamp.github.io/DataViz_2022GSERM/_sessions/markdown/Report.html).   

### 0 - Preliminaries

1. Go to the File - New File menu and select the file type R Markdown, enter the title `Do the rich get richer in Basel?` and your name, and then hit ok. 

2. Click on the little gear symbol on top of the editor and select `Preview in Viewer Pane`. 

3. Click the `Knit` button and observe whether the template content currently included in the file is correctly rendered and displayed in the Viewer Pane. When you knit for the first time, you will be asked to choose a file name. Call the document `basel_report`

4. Clear everything in the document except for the YAML header and the code chunk named `setup`.  

### 2 - Intro

1. Copy the text below right under the YAML header. 

```{}
Inequalities in income and wealth are a growing social issue FOOTNOTE. This analysis seeks to quantify inequality in Basel, Switzerland, by analyzing the widening of wealth and income gaps between the cityâ€™s quarters.
```

2. Next replace the text `FOOTNOTE` with the actual footnote `^[See https://www.un.org/en/un75/inequality-bridging-divide.]`.

3. Knit the document (i.e., hit the `Knit` button) and observe whether the new contents are accurately displayed. 

### 3 - Data

1. Create a header at the third level (`###`) with the title `Income and wealth`. 

2. Below the header add the following text. 

```{}
The data contains information on the wealth and income of the inhabitants of the INLINE quarters of Basel, which was determined from tax-return documents. The data was provided by LINK. 
```

3. Replace the text `INLINE` with a piece of inline R code determining the number of quarters in Basel, namely with 'r length(unique(basel))'. Make sure to put accents before and after the inline code (not apostrophes as used here). 

4. Replace the text `LINK` with `[Open Data Basel](https://www.opendata.bs.ch/)` to link to the Basel Open Data webpage. 

5. Knit the document and observe whether the new contents are displayed. 

### 4 - Setup

1. Before you can turn to including the visualization, you need to add a couple of items within the setup chunk (below the `opts_chunk` function). First, load the `tidyverse` and `patchwork`. Second, read in the `taxation.csv` data and call the object `basel`. Note that when running the rmarkdown file it will use its own location as the working directory. Consequently, use `../1_data/taxation.csv` as the file path. 

2. Knit the document and observe that the changes to the setup chunk have no *visible* effect due to `include = FALSE`. 

### 5 - Visualization

1. Create a header at the third level (`###`) with the title `Quantifying inequality`. 

2. Below the header, add the following text:

```{}
The figure below shows the development of income (panel A) and wealth (panel B) in Basel's quarters in the years 2001 to 2017. It can be observed that the incomes in poorer quarters in 2001 declined with time, whereas those of richer quarters rose. Similarly, wealth in poorer quarters rose less strongly than wealth in quarters that started out wealthier. These results suggest a widening of income and wealth inequality in Basel.
```

3. Next, move the cursor below the text you just added and then go to the Code menu on top and select the first option `Insert Chunk`.

4. Now, copy the following code into the newly-created, empty chunk. 

```{}
# create quarter factor
basel <- basel %>%
  arrange(year, income_mean) %>% 
  mutate(quarter = as_factor(quarter)) 
  
# create income plot
plot_income <- basel %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = year, y = income_mean, col = quarter)) +
  labs(x = "Year", y = "Income")

# create income plot
plot_wealth <- basel %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = year, y = wealth_median, col = quarter)) +
  labs(x = "Year", y = "Wealth")

# create joint plot
plot_income + plot_wealth  + 
  plot_layout(guides = "collect") +
  plot_annotation(title = "Inequality in Basel",
                  subtitle = "Income and wealth development from 2001 to 2017",
                  caption = "Source: Open Data Basel",
                  tag_levels = "A") & 
  geom_point() & 
  geom_line() &
  scale_color_viridis_d() &
  theme_minimal() &
  theme(legend.position = "bottom",
        legend.title = element_blank(),
        legend.key.height = unit(.01,"in"))
  
```

5. Knit the document and observe that there it now includes code and a visualization.

6. Add the following two changes to the chunk settings: `echo = FALSE` to hide the code (but not the visualization) and `fig.asp=.7` to use more of the width of the document, and `fig.fullwidth=TRUE`.

5. Knit the document and observe that the code is no longer visible and that the aspect ratio of the plot has changed.

### 6 - Conclusion

1. Create a header at the third level (`###`) with the title `Income and wealth`. 

2. Below the header, add the following text:

```{}
The presented analysis of income and wealth inequalities based on Basel's quarters comes with several limitations. Most importantly, the analysis does not account for mobility, implying that some of the temporal differences could driven by changes in the quarters' inhabitants. More detailed analyses which track inhabited across time will be needed to  demonstrate conclusively a widening of inequality in Basel.
```

3. Knit the document and observe that all of the report's contents are now included.

### 7 - Theme

1. Finally, change the YAML header so that a different styling theme (`flatly`) is used. Don't forget to replace `YOURNAME` with your name. See below.

```{}
---
title: "Do the rich get richer in Basel?"
date: '2022-06-23'
author: "YOURNAME
output: 
  html_document: 
    theme: flatly
---
```

2. Knit the document and observe that the report is complete..
